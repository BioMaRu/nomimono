		Nomimono is designed to make web development simple, efficient, and enjoyable. With its
		focus on ready-to-use, easy-to-customize elements, Nomimono helps you create maintainable
		design systems that are tailored to your specific needs. Whether you're building a simple
		landing page or a complex web application, Nomimono has you covered with a wide range of
		atomic classes and essential components. With Nomimono, you can spend less time worrying
		about the technical details and more time focusing on creating the perfect website for you
		and your users.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nomimono is built using SCSS, which provides a powerful and flexible way to write and
		organize your CSS. To make customization even easier, Nomimono uses CSS custom properties
		for configuring the theme and components. This means that you can change the theme or switch
		between dark and light modes by simply swapping in different theme CSS files, without the
		need for a rebuild. This allows you to quickly and easily experiment with different looks
		and styles, and ensures that your website stays looking fresh and modern no matter what
		changes you make.

<!--	For regular use cases, color is the only CSS custom property you need to change/override to create your theme.-->
<!--	<br>-->
<!--	<br>-->
<!--	Nomimono uses HSL as the primary color format and needs to be a solid color; with no alpha channel.-->
<!--	<br><br>-->
<!--	For color variation, we will work with changing its opacity.-->
<!--	<br><br>-->
<!--	The main reason to use the opacity method is we want to maintain minimum color in the systems and can blend color.-->
<!--	<br><br>-->
<!--	But if you prefer the solid color method, You can do this by changing the config and rebuilding the SCSS file. We will write the guide soon after Nomimono is stable.-->
